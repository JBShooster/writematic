# writematic
Writematic is an open-source publishing platform for anyone who is passionate about writing. The app was built on Rails with a Postgres database. For the uploading portion, I used Uploadcare as the spine of the application. It's APIs allowed me to specifize which types of files may be uploaded and protects the user on a secure HTTPS connection.
